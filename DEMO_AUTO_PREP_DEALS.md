# Auto-Prep Deal Scheduling Demo

This demo showcases the new **Auto-Prep Deal Scheduling** feature that provides complete data onboarding in a single command - from data source to storage deals.

## Overview

The auto-prep deal scheduling feature eliminates manual intervention by providing a unified `onboard` command that:
- Creates storage connections automatically
- Sets up data preparation with deal parameters
- Starts scanning, packing, and DAG generation automatically
- Creates storage deals when preparation completes
- Manages workers to process jobs automatically

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure Singularity is built with the latest changes
go build -o singularity

# Start the Singularity API (in separate terminal if not using --start-workers)
./singularity run api
```

## Simple Demo - Single Command Onboarding

The simplest way to onboard data with automatic deal creation:

```bash
# Complete onboarding in one command
./singularity onboard \
  --name "my-dataset" \
  --source "/path/to/your/data" \
  --output "/path/to/output" \
  --enable-deals \
  --deal-provider "f01234" \
  --deal-verified \
  --deal-price-per-gb 0.0000001 \
  --deal-duration "8760h" \
  --deal-start-delay "72h" \
  --start-workers \
  --wait-for-completion
```

That's it! This single command will:
1. âœ… Create source and output storage automatically
2. âœ… Create preparation with auto-deal configuration
3. âœ… Start managed workers to process jobs
4. âœ… Begin scanning immediately
5. âœ… Automatically progress through scan â†’ pack â†’ daggen â†’ deals
6. âœ… Monitor progress until completion

## Demo Script

Here's a complete demo script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Single Command Auto-Prep Deal Scheduling Demo ==="
echo

echo "ðŸš€ Starting complete data onboarding with automatic deal creation..."
echo "This will take your data from source files to Filecoin storage deals automatically."
echo

# Create some demo data if needed
mkdir -p ./demo-data ./demo-output
echo "Sample file for demo" > ./demo-data/sample.txt

echo "Running onboard command..."
./singularity onboard \
  --name "demo-auto-dataset" \
  --source "./demo-data" \
  --output "./demo-output" \
  --enable-deals \
  --deal-provider "f01234" \
  --deal-verified \
  --deal-price-per-gb 0.0000001 \
  --deal-duration "8760h" \
  --deal-start-delay "72h" \
  --start-workers \
  --max-workers 2 \
  --wait-for-completion \
  --timeout "30m"

echo
echo "ðŸŽ‰ Demo Complete!"
echo "Your data has been automatically processed and storage deals have been created."
```

## Manual Monitoring (Alternative to --wait-for-completion)

If you prefer to monitor manually instead of using `--wait-for-completion`:

```bash
# Start onboarding without waiting
./singularity onboard \
  --name "my-dataset" \
  --source "/path/to/data" \
  --enable-deals \
  --deal-provider "f01234" \
  --start-workers

# Monitor progress manually
./singularity prep status my-dataset

# Check if deals were created
./singularity deal schedule list

# View schedules for this preparation
curl http://localhost:7005/api/preparation/my-dataset/schedules
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Single Command Workflow**: Complete data onboarding in one command
2. **Automatic Storage Creation**: No need to pre-create storage connections
3. **Integrated Worker Management**: Built-in workers process jobs automatically  
4. **Automatic Job Progression**: Seamless flow from scanning to deal creation
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Built-in monitoring with timeout support
6. **Deal Configuration**: All deal parameters configured upfront

## Expected Output

When the demo completes successfully, you should see:
- âœ… Storage connections created automatically
- âœ… Preparation created with auto-deal configuration
- âœ… Workers started and processing jobs automatically
- âœ… Progress updates showing scan â†’ pack â†’ daggen â†’ deals
- âœ… Storage deals created and visible in schedule list

## Advanced Usage

```bash
# Onboard multiple sources with validation
./singularity onboard \
  --name "multi-source-dataset" \
  --source "/path/to/source1" \
  --source "/path/to/source2" \
  --output "/path/to/output1" \
  --output "/path/to/output2" \
  --enable-deals \
  --deal-provider "f01234" \
  --validate-wallet \
  --validate-provider \
  --start-workers \
  --max-workers 5

# Onboard without automatic deal creation
./singularity onboard \
  --name "prep-only-dataset" \
  --source "/path/to/data" \
  --enable-deals=false \
  --start-workers

# Run with different deal parameters
./singularity onboard \
  --name "custom-deals-dataset" \
  --source "/path/to/data" \
  --enable-deals \
  --deal-provider "f01000" \
  --deal-verified=false \
  --deal-price-per-gb 0.1 \
  --deal-duration "17520h" \
  --deal-start-delay "168h"
```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check preparation status
./singularity prep status <preparation-name>

# List all deal schedules
./singularity deal schedule list

# Check worker status (if using separate terminals)
./singularity run unified --dry-run
```

This streamlined approach reduces what used to be a complex multi-step process into a single command, making large-scale data onboarding to Filecoin much simpler and more accessible.
