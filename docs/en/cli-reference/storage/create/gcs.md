   --bucket-policy-only
      Access checks should use bucket-level IAM policies.
      
      If you want to upload objects to a bucket with Bucket Policy Only set
      then you will need to set this.
      
      When it is set, rclone:
      
      - ignores ACLs set on buckets
      - ignores ACLs set on objects
      - creates buckets with Bucket Policy Only set

   --location
      Location for the newly created buckets.

   --storage-class
      The storage class to use when storing objects in Google Cloud Storage.

      Examples:
         | <unset>                      | Default
         | MULTI_REGIONAL               | Multi-regional storage class
         | REGIONAL                     | Regional storage class
         | NEARLINE                     | Nearline storage class
         | COLDLINE                     | Coldline storage class
         | ARCHIVE                      | Archive storage class
         | DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY | Durable reduced availability storage class

   --no-check-bucket
      If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.
      
      This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
      rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.
      

   --decompress
      If set this will decompress gzip encoded objects.
      
      It is possible to upload objects to GCS with "Content-Encoding: gzip"
      set. Normally rclone will download these files as compressed objects.
      
      If this flag is set then rclone will decompress these files with
      "Content-Encoding: gzip" as they are received. This means that rclone
      can't check the size and hash but the file contents will be decompressed.
      

   --endpoint
      Endpoint for the service.
      
      Leave blank normally.

   --encoding
      The encoding for the backend.
      
      See the [encoding section in the overview](/overview/#encoding) for more info.

   --env-auth
      Get GCP IAM credentials from runtime (environment variables or instance meta data if no env vars).
      
      Only applies if service_account_file and service_account_credentials is blank.

      Examples:
         | false | Enter credentials in the next step.
         | true  | Get GCP IAM credentials from the environment (env vars or IAM).
