# Auto-deal management commands

> **ðŸ’¡ Recommendation:** For most users, the [`onboard` command](../../../README.md#basic-usage) provides a simpler single-command workflow that handles auto-deal creation automatically.

These commands provide **manual override capabilities** for advanced users who need granular control over auto-deal creation.
