# Create automatic deal schedule for a specific preparation

> **ðŸ’¡ Note:** This is a manual override command. For automated workflows, use the [`onboard` command](../../../README.md#basic-usage) which creates deal schedules automatically when jobs complete.

This command manually triggers the creation of a deal schedule for a specific preparation that has auto-deal enabled and all jobs completed.

## When to use this command

- **Manual timing control**: When you want to control exactly when deals are created
- **Debugging**: To test auto-deal functionality manually
- **Custom workflows**: When integrating with external systems that need manual triggering
- **Recovery**: If automatic deal creation failed and you need to retry manually

## Prerequisites

Before using this command, ensure:
- The preparation has `autoCreateDeals: true` 
- All jobs for the preparation are complete
- No deal schedule already exists for the preparation
- Required deal parameters are configured (provider, pricing, etc.)
