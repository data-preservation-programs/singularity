# Check if a preparation is ready for auto-deal creation

> **ðŸ’¡ Note:** This is a manual override command. For automated workflows, use the [`onboard` command](../../../README.md#basic-usage) which handles readiness checking automatically.

This command checks whether all jobs for a preparation have completed and the preparation is ready for automatic deal schedule creation.
