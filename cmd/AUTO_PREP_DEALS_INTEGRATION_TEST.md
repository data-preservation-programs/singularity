# Auto-Prep-Deals Integration Test

This document describes the comprehensive integration test for the auto-prep-deals functionality in Singularity.

## Overview

The integration test validates the complete auto-prep-deals workflow from preparation creation to deal schedule generation. It ensures that all components work together correctly and provides confidence in the implementation.

## Test Files

- `auto_prep_deals_integration_test.go` - Main integration test implementation

## What the Test Validates

### Core Workflow (`TestAutoPrepDealsIntegration`)

1. **Preparation Creation with Auto-Deals**
   - Creates preparation with `--auto-create-deals` flag
   - Verifies deal configuration is correctly stored
   - Tests various deal parameters (provider, price, verification)

2. **Auto-Storage Creation**
   - Validates that source and output storages are automatically created
   - Checks storage configuration and paths

3. **Deal Configuration Validation**
   - Verifies `AutoCreateDeals` is enabled
   - Checks deal provider, pricing, and verification settings
   - Validates configuration persistence in database

4. **Job Progression**
   - Runs dataset worker to process scan/pack/daggen jobs
   - Validates job completion and error handling
   - Tests worker orchestration

5. **Deal Schedule Auto-Creation**
   - Checks if deal schedules are automatically created
   - Validates scheduling conditions and triggers
   - Tests async deal creation workflow

6. **Manual Triggering**
   - Tests manual deal schedule creation
   - Validates manual override capabilities
   - Checks wallet validation requirements

### Error Scenarios (`TestAutoPrepDealsErrorScenarios`)

1. **Invalid Provider Validation**
   - Tests behavior with invalid storage provider IDs
   - Validates error handling and user feedback

2. **Insufficient Balance**
   - Tests high pricing scenarios
   - Validates balance checking (when enabled)

3. **Invalid Storage Provider**
   - Tests malformed provider IDs
   - Validates input validation

4. **Auto-Create-Deals Disabled**
   - Verifies that deal schedules are NOT created when disabled
   - Tests configuration isolation

## Test Architecture

### Test Data Setup
- Creates realistic test files of various sizes (1KB to 10MB)
- Uses temporary directories for source and output
- Generates deterministic test data using `testutil.GenerateFixedBytes`

### Database Testing
- Uses existing `testutil.All()` infrastructure
- Tests against SQLite (and MySQL/PostgreSQL if available)
- Each test gets isolated database instance
- Automatic cleanup after tests

### Error Handling
- Tests gracefully handle missing dependencies (Lotus API, databases)
- Validation failures are logged but don't fail tests when external services are unavailable
- Clear error messages distinguish between expected and unexpected failures

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run the main integration test
go test -v ./cmd -run TestAutoPrepDealsIntegration -timeout 10m

# Run error scenario tests
go test -v ./cmd -run TestAutoPrepDealsErrorScenarios -timeout 5m

# Run both tests
go test -v ./cmd -run "TestAutoPrepDeals.*" -timeout 10m
```

## Expected Results

### Successful Test Run

When all components are working correctly:
- ✅ Preparation created with auto-deals enabled
- ✅ 2+ local storages auto-created (source and output)
- ✅ Deal configuration correctly stored and validated
- ✅ Dataset worker completes without errors
- ✅ Deal schedules may or may not be created (depends on conditions)
- ✅ Manual schedule creation works (when wallets are configured)

### Test Logs

The test provides detailed logging:
- Storage creation details (IDs, names, paths)
- Deal configuration validation
- Worker execution output
- Schedule creation status
- Error conditions and handling

## Understanding Test Results

### "No deal schedules created yet"
This is **expected** when:
- Preparation hasn't reached the required threshold for auto-deals
- Wallet validation is enabled but no wallets are attached
- External dependencies (Lotus API) are not available in test environment

### "Manual trigger failed"
This is **expected** when:
- No wallets are attached to the preparation (`no wallet attached to preparation: not found`)
- Lotus API is not available for validation
- Deal provider validation fails

### "Validation may be disabled in test environment"
This indicates that:
- External API calls (Lotus) are not available during testing
- Validation is bypassed for test environment
- Configuration is still properly stored and processed

## Building Confidence

This integration test builds confidence by:

1. **End-to-End Validation**: Tests the complete workflow from CLI command to database state
2. **Real Data Processing**: Uses realistic file sizes and structures
3. **Error Handling**: Validates graceful degradation when external services unavailable
4. **Configuration Testing**: Ensures all deal parameters are correctly processed and stored
5. **Database Integration**: Validates data persistence and retrieval
6. **Worker Integration**: Tests job orchestration and processing
7. **Multiple Scenarios**: Covers both happy path and error conditions

## Extending the Test

To add new test scenarios:

1. **Add new test functions** following the pattern `test<ScenarioName>`
2. **Use the existing setup utilities** (`createTestFiles`, `Runner`, etc.)
3. **Follow the assertion patterns** using `require` for critical checks
4. **Add logging** with `t.Logf()` for debugging
5. **Handle expected failures** gracefully to avoid false negatives

## Integration with CI/CD

The test is designed to work in CI environments:
- Uses temporary directories for isolation
- Handles missing external dependencies gracefully
- Provides clear pass/fail criteria
- Includes timeout protection
- Generates detailed logs for debugging

This integration test provides comprehensive validation of the auto-prep-deals functionality and gives developers confidence that the complete workflow operates correctly.
